# NESSIE Figma Skill

You are working with **NESSIE**, the NS (Dutch Railways) design system. This skill helps you **design new screens** and **audit existing screens** in Figma / Figma Make so they correctly follow NESSIE components, tokens, layout, accessibility, and brand.

**Default context: iOS app.** Screens are designed iOS-first; Android is derived afterwards from the differences. Only treat a task as web or Android when the user says so.

## How to use this skill

This file is the entry point. **Read the relevant skill file before producing any design output** — do not rely on memory from a previous session. Then lazy-load only the reference files you need for that task (each `reference/` file is self-contained and skimmable).

| User intent | Read this file first — before any output | Then load |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Design / generate a new screen, view, or flow | **`/tmp/figma-skills/skills/build-screen.md`** | `reference/components/index.md`, then specific component + token + layout files |
| Review / check an existing screen against NESSIE | **`/tmp/figma-skills/skills/audit-screen.md`** | the five reference areas it lists |
| Check only token usage | **`/tmp/figma-skills/skills/audit-tokens.md`** | `reference/tokens/*` |

All paths are absolute from `/tmp/figma-skills/`. The repo is cloned fresh each session — re-read files every session, never assume you remember them.

## Reference map

- `reference/design-language.md` — brand personality, visual direction, iconography, brand-color usage. (The "what makes it feel NESSIE" doc.)
- `reference/components/index.md` — **master catalog**: every App component, when to use it, and which file documents it. Start here to pick components.
  - `navigation.md` · `buttons.md` · `forms.md` · `feedback.md` · `content.md` · `domain.md` (NS travel-planner components)
- `reference/tokens/` — `color.md` · `typography.md` · `spacing.md` · `shape.md` · `motion.md` · `applied.md`
- `reference/patterns/` — `layout.md` (app insets/stacks/surfaces/safe areas) · `navigation-patterns.md` (incl. iOS vs Android) · `accessibility.md`

## Non-negotiable rules (always apply)

1. **Tokens only.** Every color, type style, spacing, radius, and motion value comes from a NESSIE token (`base`/semantic or `applied`/component tier). Never a raw hex, never an off-scale number, never a `core`/raw-palette token used directly.
2. **Components first.** Use an existing NESSIE App component for anything it covers — never hand-roll a duplicate. Use only documented variants.
3. **Dark mode is automatic.** Tokens remap per mode; never hardcode light-mode values or branch on mode manually.
4. **Accessibility is built in, meaning is yours.** NESSIE components carry role / touch-target / heading semantics; you must still supply labels, contrast pairings, and structure (`reference/patterns/accessibility.md`).
5. **Figma generation.** Before calling `use_figma`, follow the `/figma-use` skill (mandatory). Prefer the Figma plugin's bundled skills when present.
6. **When in doubt, flag it.** If a design needs something the system doesn't have, surface it as a system gap rather than inventing a token or component.
7. **Read before you design.** When any screen or component task starts, read the skill file for that task (from the routing table above) *before* writing any design output. This is a hard gate, not a suggestion.

## Figma Make — Nessie Kit

When running in **Figma Make** (generating React/web UI), the Nessie Kit applies in addition to the rules above.

### Kit bootstrap

At the start of every session, these design-system guidelines MUST be read in full **before generating any UI**:

- `../src/NesFundamentals/guidelines/Guidelines.md` — NES Fundamentals guidelines
- `../src/NesWebComponents/guidelines/Guidelines.md` — NES Web Components guidelines

Invoke the `make-kit` skill **before** generating any UI element, updating tokens, picking icons, or reproducing an attached design or screenshot.

### Before applying styles

Before hardcoding a color, spacing, radius, font-size, or any other style value, check the kit's stylesheet for a CSS custom property that fits — e.g. `--primary-button`, `--text-default`, `--spacer-md`. Use `var(--name)` rather than raw hex / px / rem values. Hardcoded values bypass the kit's theming and break dark mode, re-skinning, and future token changes.

Some base components have styling (e.g. gap, typography) baked in as defaults. Explicitly set any styling from the guidelines in generated React to override those defaults.

## Platform notes

iOS-first. Android-specific and iOS-26+ distinctions live in clearly-marked sections of `reference/patterns/navigation-patterns.md` and as `> **Android:**` / `> **iOS 26+:**` callouts inside component files. Add new distinctions there as they're discovered.
